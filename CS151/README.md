<h1>CS151 Introduction to computing , c++ </h1>


This course introduces the fundamental concepts of the discipline of computing, emphasizing
elementary facts concerning computer architecture, programming languages, software
methodology, and algorithms. Students learn how to solve problems using an appropriate
block-structure high-level programming language. Programming topics include: basic
data structures, control structures, data and procedure abstractions, functions and function
parameters, recursion, and pointers.


                Course Objectives
                By the end of the course, students will be able to:
                1. Understand the basic syntax and semantics of the C++ programming language which
                will enable them to write and trace programs.
                2. Be fluent in the use of selection statement such as if, if-else and switch.
                3. Write programs that utiliize single dimensional arrays.
                4. Be fluent in the use of iterative statements such as while and for loops.
                5. Modulate programs with the uses of functions as well as identity function properties and
                the nuances between passing parameters by value and reference.
