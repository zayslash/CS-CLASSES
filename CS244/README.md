<h2>Object-Oriented Programming and Design.</h2>


This course presents an object-oriented approach to software development used in large-scale programming projects. A software engineering methodology, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), will be used for object, dynamic, and functional modeling. Students learn how to implement a system using an appropriate object oriented programming language. Programming topics include: Classes and data abstraction, operator overloading, inheritance, virtual functions and polymorphisms, templates, exception handling, and class libraries including GUI applications.


                Course Objectives / Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)
                By the end of this course, students will be able to:
                Demonstrate proficiency in the use of programming constructs (sequence, conditionals, and repetition), basic                   data types, string data types, arrays and structures.
                Understand and implement basic sorting and searching methods.
                Understand dynamic allocation
                Design and implement a class, clearly identifying its data and its functionality
                Understand and demonstrate the concepts of object-oriented design, inheritance, polymorphism, and information hiding.
                Design modular programs using an object-oriented programming paradigm 
                Understand and implement basic recursive functions

                Solve problems with basic data structures such as stacks and queues
