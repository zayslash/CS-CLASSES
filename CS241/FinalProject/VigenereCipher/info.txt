At about eleven in the evening, Dr. Ethan Kane trudged down the gray and blue painted
corridor toward a private elevator. His mind was filled with images of death and
suffering, but also progress, great progress that would change the world.
A young and quite homely scrub nurse rounded the corner of the passageway and nodded
her head deferentially as she approached him. She had a crush on Dr. Kane, and she
was not the only one.

nurse inferior in every way, including the fact that she was female. He was also
exhausted from a surgical marathon: five major operations in a day. The elevator
car finally arrived, the doors slid open, and he stepped inside.
“Good night, Esther,” he said, and showed the nurse a lot of very white teeth,
but no genuine warmth, because there was none to show. He straightened his tall
body and wearily passed his hand over his longish blond hair, cleaned his
wire-rimmed glasses on the tail of his lab coat, then rubbed his eyes before
putting his glasses back on as he descended to the subbasement level
