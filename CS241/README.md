<h1>Discrete Structures </h1>


This course introduces the elements of discrete mathematics systems pertinent to the field
of computer science, i.e., from the formulation of problems, to the understanding of their
underlying structure, to the comparative analysis of the complexity of algorithms that can
be used to solve these problems. Through computer programming examples, exercises and
case studies, the following mathematical concepts are applied to computer science: sets and
binary relations, functions, first-order logic, proof techniques, algebraic systems, vectors and
matrices, and finite state machines, applications of graph theory to computer science and
combinational computing are also introduced.

           Course Objectives 
        By the end of the course, students will be able to:
        1. Understand formal logic syntax and semantics as well as prove logic theorems.
        2. Demonstrate basic skills in understanding and constructing mathematical proofs.
        3. Understand recursive definitions and recurrence relations.
        4. Understand discrete math concepts.
        5. Prove the correctness of a program from its formal specifications.
