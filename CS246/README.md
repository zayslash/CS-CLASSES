<h2>Data Structures in C++</h2>


This course introduces the different ways that data is organized and stored in computer memory and the relevant procedures used in the manipulation of that data. The idea of abstract data types (ADTs) is first introduced, and then reinforced through the characterization of fundamental data structures in the discipline - stacks, queues, and trees. Other topics are recursive algorithms, dynamic storage, and complexity. Algorithms for searching and sorting are also implemented.

              IV. Course Overview 
              This course is arguably the most important course that a computer science major will take. It provides the essential building blocks utilized in software design, implementation and analysis. The course begins with a review and practice of iterative problem-solving. Students will deepen their understanding of object-oriented design and programming.  Students will also be introduced to data structures including lists, stacks, queues and trees. The course will also cover sorting algorithms, recursion, dynamic allocatiom, and an introduction to algorithmic complexity.
              V. Course Objectives / Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)
              By the end of this course, students will be able to:
              Demonstrate a familiarity with major algorithms and data structures.
              Analyze common computing operations performed on a variety of data structures using asymptotic and amortized analysis as appropriate.
              Choose an appropriate data structure based on application requirements.
              Use and/or modify major data structures and algorithms in a complex application.
              Understand and formulate recursive solutions to problems.
